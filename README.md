# personal-portfolio

This is my portfolio website. Its mobile responsive (I am very happy). Built using React and Typescript with Framer Motion for smooth animations. Following awesome libraries were used for some effects that you can find on this webpage: [react-powerglitch](https://github.com/7PH/react-powerglitch), [react-random-reveal](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-random-reveal), [typewriter-effect](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs).

Image in the hero section of the website is from [SVG backgrounds](SVGBackgrounds.com) which provides capabilities to customize SVG images from the pool of templates.
